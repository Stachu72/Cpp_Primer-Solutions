### Exercise 2.06

What, if any, are the differences between the following definitions:

    int month = 9, day = 7;
    int month = 09, day = 07;

### Solution

* The first line initalizes variables with decimal literals.
* Because of zero perfix, the second line uses octal literals, where `09` is an invalid literal.
