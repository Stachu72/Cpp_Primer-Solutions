### Exercise 2.01

What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short?
Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double?

### Solution

1. `int`, `long`, `long long` and `short` are integral types that differ in their minimum size in bits. This means their minimum and maximum values are different.<br><br>

    Minimum Size (at least):
    * `int` 16 bits
    * `short` same as `int` 16 bits
    * `long` 32 bits
    * `long long` 64 bits<br><br>

2. Integral types can be `signed` or `unsigned` (except for boolean and extended character types).
`Signed` variables can contain negative to positive numbers, and `unsigned` ones only positive (including 0).<br><br>

    For example:
     * `signed short` contains -32,768 to 32,767
     * `unsigned short` contains 0 to 65,535.<br><br>

    Every integral type is `signed` by default, except `char` type, which is not defined in the standard.<br><br>

3. `Float` and `double` are floating-point types. These types cannot be `unsigned`, and differ in precision.<br><br>

    Precision (at least):
    * `float` 6 significant digits
    * `double` 10 significant digits<br><br>

    `float` usually does not have enough precision, and the cost of double-precision calculations versus single-precision is negligible.
