### Exercise 2.14

Is the following program legal? If so, what values are printed?

    int i = 100, sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
        sum += i;
    std::cout << i << " " << sum << std::endl;

### Solution

The following program is legal. It prints out the valie `100` from `i` which is in outer scope. Then it prints out the sum of numbers between 0 and 10.
