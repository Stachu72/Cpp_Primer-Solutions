### Exercise 2.12

Which, if any, of the following names are invalid?

(a) `int double = 3.14;`\
(b) `int _;`\
(c) `int catch-22;`\
(d) `int 1_or_2 = 1;`\
(e) `double Double = 3.14;`


### Solution

(a) Invalid - `double` is reserved name in the c++ standard.\
(b) Valid - underscore can occur independently.\
(c) Invalid - the declarator contains `catch`, which is reserved in the c++ standard.\
(d) Invalid - a declarator cannot start with a number.\
(e) Valid - c++ distinguishes lower- and uppercase letters. `Double` is not the same as `double`.
