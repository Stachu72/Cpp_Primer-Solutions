### Exercise 2.13

What is the value of `j` in the following program?

    int i = 42;
    int main()
    {
        int i = 100;
        int j = i;
    }

### Solution

The value of `j` is equal to `100`. The `i` with the value `42` is in the outer scope, so `j` is initialized with `i` being in the inner scope.
