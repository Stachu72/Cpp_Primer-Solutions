### Exercise 2.09

Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal, explain whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it.

(a) std::cin >> int input_value;\
(b) int i = { 3.14 };\
(c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;\
(d) int i = 3.14;

### Solution

a) Right-hand operand of `std::cin` expression must be an object. The definition of `input_value` should appear before this expression.\
b) The `3.14` value is a double type. It cannot be assigned to int type with list initalization. We should truncated the value, or use another form of initalization.\
c) Incorrect initialization, the list of declarators should be separated by commas, not the `= sign`. Possibly solution: `double salary = 9999.99, wage = salary;`\
d) The `3.14` will be truncated and `i` will store `3` as the value.
