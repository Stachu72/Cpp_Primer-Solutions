### Exercise 1.17

What happens in the program presented in this section if the input val-
ues are all equal? What if there are no duplicated values?

* If all inputs values are equal, the program prints a single line. E.g `30 occurs 4 times`.
* If there are no duplicated values, the program prints as many lines as the number of values we entered.
