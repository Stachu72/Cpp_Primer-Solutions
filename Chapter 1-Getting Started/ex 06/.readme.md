### Exercise 1.06

Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.

    std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
        << " and " << v2;
        << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;

If the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why not? How
would you fix it?

### Solution

* The fragment progam is illegal. The `<<` operator should have streams on its left side. A fix would be to remove semicolons at the end of first and second lines, or add `std::cout` at the beggning of the second and third line.
