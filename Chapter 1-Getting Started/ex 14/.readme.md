### Exercise 1.14

Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with those using a
while. Are there advantages or disadvantages to using either form?

### Solution

    while (condition) { code.. }
    for (init;condition;execution) { code.. }

The main difference between `for` and `while` is clarity. The `for` loop contains initialization, condition and execution in a single line, while the `while` forces us to break these statements into seperate lines. But `while()` statement is cleaner than `for( ; ; )`. The use of these two depends on circumstances.

##### For example

* If you want to create loop based on numbers - you should consider a `for` loop.
* A `while` loop would be a better solution for boolean variables.
